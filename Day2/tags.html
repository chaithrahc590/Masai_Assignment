<h1> <b> tag </h1> 
<p>The <b>HTML</b> element is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents,
which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface.
</p> 

<h1> <i> tag </h1> 
<p>The <i>HTML</i> element represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, 
such as idiomatic text, technical terms, or fictional character thoughts. In most browsers, the text is displayed in italic.
</p> 

<h1> <u> tag </h1> 
<p>The <u>HTML</u> element renders text with an underline. It signifies that the enclosed text is a non-textual annotation, 
such as labeling a text as being misspelled or a proper noun in Chinese text (due to the lack of spacing in Chinese characters).
</p> 

<h1> <select> tag </h1> 
<p>The <select>HTML</select> element represents a control that provides a menu of options. Users can select one or more options from the list, 
depending on the `multiple` attribute. The selected option(s) can be retrieved via scripting using the `value` property.
</p> 

<h1> <button> tag </h1> 
<p>The <button>HTML</button> element represents a clickable button. It can be used to submit forms, trigger JavaScript functions,
or navigate to a different URL when clicked. The content of the button is defined between the opening and closing tags.
</p>

<h1> <hr> tag </h1> 
<p>The <hr>HTML</hr> element represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements. It is typically used to separate sections of content visually by drawing a horizontal line across the page. 
It doesn't require a closing tag as it is a self-closing element.
</p>

<h1> <br> tag </h1> 
<p>The <br>HTML</br> element represents a line break within text content or empty lines between block-level elements. It is used to create a single line break, 
forcing the text or elements to continue on the next line. It doesn't require a closing tag as it is a self-closing element.
